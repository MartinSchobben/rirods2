Description: The Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System 'iRODS'
    (<https://irods.org/>) open sourced data management software suite
    offer solutions which encompasses the whole data life cycle from data
    generation, storage and recycling. The loosely constructed and highly
    configurable architecture of iRODS frees the user from strict
    formatting constrains and single-vendor solutions. This package
    provides an R interface to iRODS' REST API, allowing you to manage
    your data from your own machine.
