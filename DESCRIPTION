Description: The Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System 'iRODS' 
 (<https://irods.org/>) open sourced data management software suite offer 
 solutions which encompasses the whole data life cycle from 
 data generation, storage and recycling. The loosely constructed and highly 
 configurable architecture of iRODS frees the user from strict formatting 
 constrains and single-vendor solutions. This package provides an R interface to 
 iRODS' REST API, allowing you to manage your data from your own machine.
