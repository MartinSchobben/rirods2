\title{Get or set current working directory in iRODS}
\usage{
icd(dir)

ipwd()
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Collection to set as working directory.}
}
\value{
Invisibly the current directory before the change (same convention as
\code{setwd()}).
}
\description{
\code{ipwd()} and \code{icd()} are the iRODS equivalents of \code{getwd()} and \code{setwd()}
respectively. For example, whereas \code{getwd()} returns the current working directory
in the local system, \code{ipwd()} returns the current working directory in iRODS.
}
